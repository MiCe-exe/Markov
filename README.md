# Markov Project
Project is to simulate basic understanding using Hashmaps instead of Markov. The purpose of this obtain experience working with Hashmaps and a primitive algorithm. It suppose to simulate a Markov chain without the complexity of a Markov chain. 

The `Markov.java` has the main algorithm. Its job is to record a word as a Key and add the next word as its value with the Hashmap. Next it generates a random story based on the text it was feed.

The `main.java` creates Markov object. Where itâ€™s assigned a text file with the words. Have it generated sentences based on a for loop.
